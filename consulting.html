		<h1>HYPER AUTOMATION</h1>
		<span></span>
		<p>As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” </p>

		<h1>Multiexperience</h1>
		<span></span>
		<p>MXDPs serve to centralize life cycle activities — designing, developing, testing, distributing, managing and analyzing — for a portfolio of multiexperience apps. Multiexperience refers to the various permutations of modalities (e.g., touch, voice and gesture), devices and apps that users interact with on their digital journey across the various touchpoints. Multiexperience development involves creating fit-for-purpose apps based on touchpoint-specific modalities, while at the same time ensuring a consistent user experience across web, mobile, wearable, conversational and immersive touchpoints. </p>

		<h1>Distribution Cloud</h1>
		<span></span>
		<p>Distributed cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations.

		Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple systems which may also be in different locations. Distributed cloud speeds communications for global services and enables more responsive communications for specific regions. </p>
